1. Serial.begin(9600) or
   Serial.begin(12500)	--> This function helps to communicate between the Computer and Arduino
			--> Without this function the Arduino and PC can't communicate to each other
			--> This function also helps to Transfer the Data to each other
			--> Serial.begin(9600) -- here 9600 is a value in bits/second which is for Data Transfer

2. pinMode(pin, ,mode)
    --> mode = INPUT/OUTPUT
    --> This function tells to Arduino that which number of pin we will use and for input/output

        --> mode has an option called INPUT_PULLUP
        --> which sets the default value of input as HIGH

3. digitalWrite(pin, value)
    --> value = HIGH/LOW
    --> This function tells to Arduino that which number of pin will receive/transfer which kind of data
    --> Setting Mode to HIGH will transfer 5V from that number of pin
    --> Setting Mode to LOW will transfer 0V from that number of pin

4. delay(milliseconds)
    --> delay function can pause the Arduino at the specific line for milliseconds you entered

5. Serial.read()
    --> Serial.read() function will read the Data from the Input
    --> You can also store the Data to any variable using the Serial.read()
    --> This function takes the input from the Serial Monitor

6. Serial.print()
    --> Serial.print() function can print the value of the variable
    --> Serial.print() function prints the value of variable in the Serial Monitor
    --> Serial.println() does the same thing, but it adds a '\n' automatically at the end of the print statement.

7. Serial.available()
    --> Serial.available() is a function which can helps to identify that the PC and Arduino are communicating to each other with the Serial Port or not
    --> That's basically return the value '1' is they are communicating, otherwise return 0

8. Storage, Data Type, and Range
    --> 1. Byte - storage = 8-bit - Range(0, 255)
    --> 2. Word - storage = 16-bit - Range(0, 65,535)
    --> 3. Short - storage = 16-bit - Range(-32,768, 32,767)
    --> 4. Int - storage = 16-bit - Range(-32,768, 32,767)
    --> 5. Long - storage = 32-bit - Range(-2,147,483,647,  2,147,483, 647)
    --> 6. Float - Range(-3.4028235 * 10^38, 3.4028235 * 10^38)
    --> 7. Unsigned Int - storage = 16-bit - Range(0, 65,535)
    --> 8. Unsigned Long - storage = 32-bit - range(0, -4,294,967,295)

9. String and Character
    --> Character must be in single quote
            char variable = 'value';
    --> String must be in Double quote
            String variable = "Value of the Variable \n This is the Paragraph";

    --> Syntax of Array is much similar to C language

10. digitalRead(pin)
    --> digitalRead() is a function which is used to Read the Data from the Digital Pin
    --> Here 'pin' is the number of the pin which will receive Data and digitalRead() will read it.

11. analogRead(analogPin)
    --> analogRead() function can read the input from the analog pins of the Arduino Board
    --> It takes the input in the range of 0V to 5V
    --> It is only made for the analog pins
        --> Analog pins : For Digital Output
                          For Digital Input
                          For Analog Input

12. analogWrite(PMWpin, value)
    --> range of value is 0 to 255
    --> analogWrite() function can write the analog value to PWM pins (~[number] pins on the Arduino)
        --> PWM stand for Pulse Width Modulation
        --> PWM pins are 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 at the Digital port of Arduino
    --> Analog pin will generate the value of 0V to 5V depends on the Input of 0 to 255
    --> It can be used to light the LED at varying Brightness or drive a motor at various speed.
